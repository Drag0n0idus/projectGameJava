# Simple 2D RPG made in Java (personal project)
Personal (partially made for school) project - a simple 2D RPG i'll be making in Java. 

The plan is to make a grid-map, have a main class for the human race, subclasses for ... well, classes (mage, knight, etc.). Other stuff will include equipment made from static objects, some damage math and such, some text based encounters.

I still have to think of a way to make combat. I know it will be turn-based (somewhat easier to make), but the details are yet to be fleshed out.

## What I have planned to do and whats already done
### Classes & Races
- [x] Race Human (*Base atrributes for the human race*)
### Menu design
- [x] Start menu
- [ ] Character Menu
### Combat
- [ ] Damage counting (*How equipment affects damage output, armor, health*)
- [ ] Status effects (*How to get an enemy to skip a turn when stunned, how much damage to take of when poisoned, bleeding etc.*)
### World
- [ ] Creating a map (*Make a grid-map, get it into a two dimensional array, define positions etc.*)
- [ ] Movement (*How to move on said map*)
### Equipment
- [ ] Drop chance (*Defining how often loot will drop and what rarity (strength) it will be*)
