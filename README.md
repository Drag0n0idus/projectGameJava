# Simple 2D RPG made in Java (personal/school project)
Personal (partially made for school) project - a simple 2D RPG we'll be making in Java. 

The plan is to make a grid-map, have a main class for the human race, subclasses for ... well, classes (mage, knight, etc.). Other stuff will include equipment made from static objects, some damage math and such, some text based encounters.

We still have to think of a way to make combat. We know it will be turn-based (somewhat easier to make), but the details are yet to be fleshed out.

## What we have planned to do and what we've already done
